# GitHub Commit Monitor

A sleek, minimalist app to monitor your GitHub commits and alarm you if you are being a lazy idiot.
## Features

- Monitor any GitHub repository
- Set custom check intervals
- Choose your own alert sound
- Sleek, modern UI

## Setup

First, clone the repo:

`https://github.com/MangyMango/Github-Commit-moniter.git`

Then, navigate to the project directory:

`cd Github-Commit-Monitor`

Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

## Usage

To start the app, run:

`npm start`

You'll need to enter your GitHub personal access token with repo access, the repository you want to monitor, and set your preferred check interval and time threshold and a sound effect to play.

This will create executables in the `dist` folder.
